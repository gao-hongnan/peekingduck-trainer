    "\n",
    "In object-oriented design, the [dependency inversion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle) is a specific methodology for loosely coupling software modules. When following this principle, the conventional dependency relationships established from high-level, policy-setting modules to low-level, dependency modules are reversed, thus rendering high-level modules independent of the low-level module implementation details. The principle states:[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "- High-level modules should not import anything from low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces).\n",
    "- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "By dictating that both high-level and low-level objects must depend on the same abstraction, this design principle inverts the way some people may think about object-oriented programming.[2]\n",

    "### Low Level and High Level Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Low level modules are \"low level\" because they have no dependencies, or no relevant dependencies. Very often, they can be easily reused in different contexts without introducing any separate, formal interfaces - which means, reusing them is straightforward, simple and does not require any Dependency Inversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "High level modules, however, are \"high level\", because they require other, lower level modules to work. But if they are tied to a specific low-level implementation, this often prevents to reuse them in a different context.\n",
    "\n",
    "High level modules depend on low level modules, but shouldn't depend on their implementation. This can be achieved by using interfaces, thus decoupling the definition of the service from the implementation.\n",

We can create an interface `Transforms` that will be implemented by `ImageClassificationTransforms`, `ImageSegmentationTransforms`, etc. Then, we can pass the `Transforms` object to the `CustomDataset` constructor `__init__` method. This way, the `CustomDataset` will depend on the `Transforms` interface and not on the `ImageClassificationTransforms` class.
